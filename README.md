# Brain-Stroke-Prediction

Description:

The Random Forest algorithm is used in this model to estimate the risk of a brain stroke. The model is trained using a dataset of patient records that contains data on the patient's age, gender, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators. This data is then used by the algorithm to forecast the likelihood of a stroke occurring.

Benefits:

->The model can be used to identify people who are at high risk of having a stroke so that they can be closely followed and treated as soon as possible.
->The model can be used to create stroke preventive measures.
->The model can be used to increase stroke risk prediction accuracy.

How to Apply:

Healthcare practitioners can use the model to forecast the risk of a stroke in their patients. Individuals can also use the model to determine their own risk of having a stroke. To use the model, you must enter your age, gender, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health information. The model will then predict your risk of having a stroke.
